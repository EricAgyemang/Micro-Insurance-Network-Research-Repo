 # Inclusive Insurance Market Development (II): Creating a fertile environment
The rate of uptake of microinsurance differs markedly from one country to another, even within a single region. Taking the quantitative approach, 
multilinear regression, this research focuses on:
    •	Drawing on the literature available and interviews with subject matter experts, develop a hypothesis for testing the contribution of key variables 
      towards market development.
    •	Collate data from a range of public sources to enable cross-country comparison with respect to demographics, each country’s socio-economic profile, 
      financial inclusion and the insurance sector itself. This data will also be used to generate the country profiles that are part of the 2020 Landscape 
      Study of Microinsurance (see appendix).
    •	Additional data sources may need to be found to represent proxies for other variables to be included in the hypothesis testing. For example, these may
      include: growth of microinsurance; economic growth; economic and/or political stability; ease of doing business. 
    •	Test the hypothesis through a cross-country comparison
    •	Analyze and present the results
 
# QUESTION ADDRESSED 
    a.	What are the key factors commonly believed to be prerequisites for success in creating a fertile environment for the development
         of inclusive insurance markets?
    b.	Does an evidence-based approach support this?
    c.	What are the implications for policymakers and the private sector wishing to scale up inclusive insurance market development?


#	SUMMARY OF RESEARCH
This study focuses on key factors influencing microinsurance market development and creating fertile environment for microinsurance operation. Using data covering 
110 observations in 22 African countries for the years 2014 – 2018, this work focuses on demographic, economic, and institutional variables’ influence on microinsurance
density used as a gauge of microinsurance development, and ease of doing business as a gauge of how conducive the regulatory environment is to starting and operating a 
local firm. Employing the multilinear regression approach, key findings show that merchandised trade, and business freedom positively influence microinsurance development
while population growth Rate, mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions, percentage of population living in rural area, inflation, and real interest rate, all negatively 
influence microinsurance development.  Percentage of individual using internet, GNI per capita, real interest rate, business freedom, openness of economy, and property 
right, all influence positively to conducive environment to starting and operating local firms. Some implications of these key finding are discussed.

# HYPOTHESES
The hypothesis used for the study include:
  •	Hypothesis 1: Demographic factors positively affect microinsurance market development and creating fertile environment for microinsurance operation.
  •	Hypothesis 2: Economic factors positively affect microinsurance market development and creating fertile environment for microinsurance operation.
  •	Hypothesis 3: Institutional factors positively affect microinsurance market development and creating fertile environment for microinsurance operation.
